# PTT_movie_review

This repository stores approximately 6300 positive and 2200 negative reviewed articles crawled from PTT movie board. We use this corpus in our work in "Sentiment Analysis on Chinese Movie Review with Distributed Keyword Vector Representation" (2016). Under Clause 52 of the copyright law in Taiwan, one is allowed to use literature that is already published within a reasonable scope for the purposes of journalism, education, and research. As a result, we provided these articles for anyone who wishes to conduct sentiment analysis in Chinese, while reserving the source and ID of the original writer of each review for data integrity.

If the data suits your need, feel free to use it and make certain citation of our work.
